# Project Title

COVID Daily Cases

## Project Description

This project delivery a REST API that uses a COVID history cases on .csv file available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yamqwe/omicron-covid19-variant-daily-cases).

The project has APIs to show the number of COVID cases by location, date and variant name.

## The data

### `location`

This is the country for which the variants information is provided;

### `date`

Date for the data entry;

### `variant`

This is the variant corresponding to this data entry;

### `num_sequences`

The number of sequences processed (for the country, variant and date);

### `perc_sequences`

Percentage of sequences from the total number of sequences (for the country, variant and date);

### `numsequencestotal`

Total number of sequences (for the country, variant and date);

## API rotes

The routes are prepared for versioning as the project grows and as needed, and were configured to work with the Version 1 (v1).

To access the APIs use the URL: [http://18.231.191.95:8000/](http://18.231.191.95:8000/v1/) or [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) if the app running on developement mode, and add the routes below after the URL to access the APIs data.

The postman scripts, used to test the API routes, is included on the project root folder `covid-daily-cases.postman_collection.json`.\
You can import it on [Postman](https://www.postman.com/).

The routes available are:

### GET [/v1/](http://18.231.191.95:8000/v1/)

Returns status 200 and the message "Backend Challenge 2022 üèÖ - Covid Daily Cases".

### GET [/v1/cases/:date/count](http://18.231.191.95:8000/v1/cases/2020-07-06/count)

Lists all records on database on a given `date`, grouped by location and order by variant.

### GET [/v1/cases/:date/cumulative](http://18.231.191.95:8000/v1/cases/2020-07-06/cumulative)

Lists all records on database, returning the sum of cases of a given `date`, grouped by location and order by variant.

### GET [/v1/dates](http://18.231.191.95:8000/v1/dates/)

Lists all dates recorded on database.
